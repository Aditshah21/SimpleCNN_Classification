# SimpleCNN_Classification
A simple convolutional neural network which predicts the images based on input

So, I have make this simple CNN network to make predictions in base of classification like dog,cat or human,animal.
I am taking this course on Udemy called Deep Learning A-Z.

From this program, you'll be able to understand how to build a CNN from scratch with image augmentation and building neural network.
Don't forget to download all necessary libraries like TensorFlow, Keras and Numpy.
Enjoy!
